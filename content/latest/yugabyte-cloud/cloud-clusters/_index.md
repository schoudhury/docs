To ensure the cluster configuration matches its performance requirements, you can [monitor key database performance metrics](../cloud-monitor/) and scale the cluster vertically or horizontally as your requirements change. You can also change the default backup policy for clusters and perform on-demand backups. You access your clusters from the **Clusters** page.

The **Clusters** page lists your currently provisioned clusters and their status, along with a summary of the total number of clusters, nodes, and vCPUs in your cloud. From here you can also [add](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/) and delete clusters.

To _add_ a cluster, click **Add Cluster**. Refer to [Create a cluster](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/).

To _delete_ a cluster, click the three dots icon for the cluster you want to delete and choose **Terminate Cluster**. Then enter the name of the cluster and click **Delete**. This deletes the cluster and all of its data, including backups.

To _manage_ a cluster, select the cluster in the list to display the cluster [Overview](../cloud-monitor/overview). Once you've selected a cluster, you can access [backups](backup-clusters/), and [scale the cluster](configure-clusters/).
