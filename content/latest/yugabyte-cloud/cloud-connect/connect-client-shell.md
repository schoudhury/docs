Connect to your YugabyteDB cluster from your desktop using the YugabyteDB [ysqlsh](../../../admin/ysqlsh) and [ycqlsh](../../../admin/ycqlsh) client shells installed on your computer. Because YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL-compatible, you can also use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to connect.

You can download and install the YugabyteDB Client Shell and connect to your database by following the steps below for either YSQL or YCQL.

Before you can connect using a shell, you need to add your computer to an IP allow list for the cluster. Refer to [Assign IP Allow Lists](../../cloud-basics/add-connections/).

{{< note title="Note" >}}

You must add your computer to the cluster [IP allow list](../../cloud-basics/add-connections/) before you can connect from a remote shell.

When connecting via Yugabyte Client Shell, ensure you are running the latest versions of the shells (Yugabyte Client 2.6 or later). See [How do I connect to my cluster?](../../cloud-faq/#how-do-i-connect-to-my-cluster) in the FAQ for details.

## SSL modes in YSQL

Yugabyte Cloud requires SSL connections. The generated `ysqlsh` shell command and application connection string use the `verify-full` SSL mode by default to verify the cluster’s identity. This mode encrypts the data in transit to ensure a secure connection to your cluster, and prevents man in the middle (MITM) attacks, impersonation attacks, and eavesdropping. Connections using SSL mode `disable` will fail. You can use other SSL modes to connect to clusters as described in the following table.

| sslmode | MITM protection | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| allow | No | Effectively works as _require_ (always uses the SSL connection without verification). |
| prefer | No | Effectively works as _require_ (always uses the SSL connection without verification). |
| require | No | Uses the SSL connection without verification. You do not need to provide the _sslrootcert_ parameter. |
| verify-ca | Yes | Uses the SSL connection and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Requires the _sslrootcert_ parameter with the path to the cluster certificate. |
| verify-full | Yes | Uses the SSL connection and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a trusted CA and that the requested server host name matches that in the certificate. Requires the _sslrootcert_ parameter with the path to the cluster certificate. |

If you don't provide an `sslmode`, the connection defaults to `prefer`.

For information on SSL modes, refer to [Protection Provided in Different Modes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Connect using psql

To connect using [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), first download the CA certificate for your cluster by clicking **Connect**, selecting **YugabyteDB Client Shell**, and clicking **Download CA Cert**. Then use the following connection string:

```sh
psql --host=<HOST_ADDRESS> --port=5433 \
--username=<DB USER> \
--dbname=yugabyte \
--set=sslmode=verify-full \
--set=sslrootcert=<ROOT_CERT_PATH>
```

Replace the following:

- `<HOST_ADDRESS>` with the value for host as shown on the **Settings** tab for your cluster.
- `<DB USER>` with your database username.
- `yugabyte` with the database name, if you're connecting to a database other than the default (yugabyte).
- `<ROOT_CERT_PATH>` with the path to the root certificate on your computer.

## Connect using third party clients

Because YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL-compatible, you can use third party PostgreSQL clients to connect to your YugabyteDB clusters in Yugabyte Cloud. To create connections to your cluster in Yugabyte Cloud, follow the client's configuration steps for PostgreSQL, but use the value for host as shown on the **Settings** tab for your cluster, port 5433, and the username and password of a user with permissions for the cluster.

For detailed steps for configuring popular third party tools, see [Third party tools](../../../tools/). In that section, configuration steps are included for the following tools:

- DBeaver
- DbSchema
- pgAdmin
- SQL Workbench/J
- TablePlus
- Visual Studio Workbench
