To secure your cluster from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and brute force password attacks, access to your clusters is restricted to IP addresses that you specify in IP allow lists. An IP allow list is simply a set of IP addresses and ranges that, when assigned to a cluster, grant access to connections made from those addresses; all other connections are ignored. Yugabyte Cloud only allows client connections to clusters from addresses in IP allow lists that have been assigned to the cluster.

Each entry can either be a single IP address, a CIDR-notated range of addresses, or a comma-delimited list of addresses.

The IP allow lists assigned to a cluster are listed under **Network Access** on the cluster **Settings** tab.

## Assign an IP allow list to a cluster

To add IP allow lists to a cluster:

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the cluster, and select the **Settings** tab.
1. Under **Network Access**, click **Add List** to display the **Add IP Allow List** sheet.
    \
    The sheet lists all IP allow lists that have been created for your cloud.

1. Select the box for the IP allow lists you want to assign to the cluster.
1. If you do not have any IP allow lists or want to create a new one, click **Create New List and Add to Cluster** and do the following:
    - Enter a name and description for the list.
    - Enter one or more IP addresses or CIDR ranges; delimit entries using commas or new lines.
    - Click **Detect and add my IP to this list** to add your own IP address.
1. Click **Save** when done.

The allow list takes up to 30 seconds to become active

## Manage IP allow lists

Any IP allow list that you create is also added to your cloud's **Network Access**.

The **IP Allow List** tab displays a list of IP allow lists configured for your cloud.

To view an existing IP allow list, select it in the list.

### Create an IP allow list

To create an IP allow list:

1. On the **Network Access** page, select the **IP Allow List** tab.
1. Click **Add IP Address** to display the **Add IP Allow List** sheet.
1. Enter a name and description for the allow list.
1. Enter the IP addresses and ranges. Each entry can either be a single IP address, a CIDR-notated range of addresses, or multiple comma-delimited addresses.
1. Click **Detect and add my IP to this list** to add the IP address of the computer you are using to access Yugabyte Cloud.
1. Click **Add** when you are done.

The allow list takes up to 30 seconds to become active.
